Here are the commands which we tested your proxy server with.
For curl, it should produce the same result from your proxy
as the direct connection. Example:

curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html > actual
curl -0 -x localhost:8000 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html > proxied
diff actual proxied

diff will output nothing if the files are identical, in which case you
pass the test case.

Test Cases
----------
1. Handling small file and images (2 marks)
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html (1)
curl -0 http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/img/doge.jpg (1)

2. Handling complex webpages (2 marks)
wget -p www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/www.comp.nus.edu.sg (2)
wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080 -p www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/www.comp.nus.edu.sg

wget download the entire site into a directory structure.
So run wget in two different directories then diff the two directories e.g.:
diff -r original/www.comp.nus.edu.sg/ proxy/www.comp.nus.edu.sg

3. Handling large file (2 marks)
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/a1/large.mp4 (2)
The md5sum of large.mp4 should match. Just like in assignment 0.

4. Handling 404 and 502 error messages
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/notfound.html (1)
curl -0 www.ccc.nus.edu.sg/ (1)
We check if the correct 502 status code is in the HTTP response.

5. Handle POST
curl -0 --data "name=Peter&city=Singapore" http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/demo_test_post.asp  (2)

6. Handle custom port
curl -0 portquiz.net:1234/  (1)

portquiz.net actually sends different contents if it detects that the User-Agent is curl.
If you are getting the full HTML thru your proxy, then it means you did not forward the headers
correctly.

7. Normal caching
We have set up our web server on sunfire on port 8888.
Now the page "sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg:8888/cachethis" will always return a random number in the page.
If your proxy has normal caching, you should get the same contents on subsequent requests thru curl
curl -0 -x localhost:XXXX sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg:8888/cachethis

8. Adv caching
There is another page "sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg:8888/cachethis" that our web server will serve.
This page will return a Last-Modified header but never respond with a 304.
Thus if you have advanced caching, you will see a different number each time.
But if you only did normal caching, you would have cached it and returned the same contents.
curl -0 -x localhost:XXXX sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg:8888/nocache

9. Text censoring
curl -0 http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/sherlock.txt
words in censor.txt: Adler, Watson (1)
words in censor.txt: quite, then, peculiar (1)

10. Multi-threading
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/a1/large.mp4 +
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html (2)

Open two windows, and with one request large.mp4 and while large.mp4 is downloading,
request for demo.html in the other. If your proxy supports multi-threading, then 
demo.html will be downloaded before large.mp4 completes.
